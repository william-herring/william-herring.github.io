                My passion for computer programming and creating digital solutions started with some clueless tinkering in a BASIC editor and
                interpreter app that my dad had installed on my iPad when I was about 8 years old. After enough playing around with the app's sample files,
                I started to figure a few things out for myself. It wasn't long after that I dove in head-first, following along to Derek Banas' Java and Python tutorials.

                I'm now commencing my first year of computer science at RMIT. For me, software development has always been as simple as solving problems with
                digital systems. I like to look to at the problems that are relevant to me and the way that most people work around them, and ask myself,
                "How can I change the way this is done? How can I do it better? How can I do it in a way that will help everyone?". So often, I answer each of those questions
                by imagining a software implementation. Really, that's what I like about software development - making cool shit that makes life easier.
                <br><br>
                When I'm not working on a project though, I'm a pretty active member of the Australian speedcubing scene. Competing regularly since 2019, I have attended a number
                of national and continental championships and reached a career-best ranking of 7<sup>th</sup> in Australia (149<sup>th</sup> in the world) for the Pyraminx event in 2023.
                I also enjoy playing tennis, watching movies and spending time with my girlfriend, friends and family (including my 11-year-old Labrador Dozer).
