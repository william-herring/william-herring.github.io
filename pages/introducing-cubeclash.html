      <h3>Introducing CubeClash</h3>
      <p class="page-date">Feb 6, 2026</p>
      <p>
        Very recently, I started work on an exciting new online speedcubing platform.
        <br><br>
        As many in the community would be aware, 3x3 head-to-head formats have garnered enormous support over the past couple of years, particularly
        popularity of events like Monkey League, SSL, PSL, and the recent implementation of the H2H finals format for major WCA competitions.
        These formats are engaging for competitors and spectators alike, and help to facilitate direct, high-stakes competitiveness in speedcubing.
        <br><br>
        What I have found particularly appealing about head-to-head is its organisational simplicity: you only need two willing competitors to set up a match.
        That's what inspired me to explore the possibility of an online competitive H2H speedcubing platform.
        <br><br>
        The concept of CubeClash can be compared to that of chess.com or other ELO-based one-on-one eSports. CubeClash would use an ELO system to enable effective
        head-to-head matchmaking. I believe it has the potential to become a major, accessible and competitive outlet for speedcubers around the world. I'll keep some of the
        details about exciting planned features a secret just for now, but you can expect to see development progress and announcements in the coming months ;)
        <br><br>
        I'll leave you with the below screenshot as something of an intriguing first glimpse.
