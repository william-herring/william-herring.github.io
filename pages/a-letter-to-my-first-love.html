      <h3>A letter to my first love</h3>
      <p>
        Dear Anna,
        <br><br>
        When we met again towards the end of 2022, my life suddenly started to feel exciting in a way it hadn’t really felt before. There was this rush that came with talking more and more to you because I knew it meant something. Years had passed since we fell out of contact with all that happened in 2022, and we were these two people with an already meaningful shared past becoming close again. At the same time though, I was meeting a totally different version of you, and so were you me. We’d both grown so much and I was at a stage where I was really beginning to feel comfortable with myself and my perceived identity. Because of that, getting to know you and grow closer to you for the second time just felt different, but so so exciting.
        <br><br>
        In 2025, we became increasingly closer, and with that, I developed feelings I had never experienced before. I would start feeling excited for after-school SACs or the times when your friends were talking at recess with my friends because I knew it was an excuse to see you. The little moments of progress in our friendship excited me: seeing that first close friends story, getting a video sent to me out of the blue just because you thought I would like it, it made me feel actually giddy. I was excited at the fantastical idea of you feeling the same way about me, but so scared at the same time. There were times when I told myself I should just be grateful that you’re back in my life as a friend and that it wasn’t worth risking losing what we had. Yet, my mind would always come back to the way I really felt. Laying in bed, Luna Park, library trips, for the first time, I knew exactly how I felt; “Damn I like everything about this girl”.
        <br><br>
        June came around, holidays approaching. I knew how I felt, and I really started to think about how much regret I would feel if I didn’t at least try. We were already talking outside of school pretty often, and I sent you that Star Wars café reel. I knew when I sent it, I wanted to go with you. It was a shot in the dark, and I expected nothing, or at least for me to chicken out. But you remarked about how you need to go to expand your Star Wars knowledge. I remember this conversation so clearly because my heart was beating at a million miles an hour, as stupid as it sounds. Next thing, we were talking about how booked out it was. “Oh well, maybe I’ll go during the holidays”. It took an embarrassing amount of courage for me to make the suggestion that we could go together. My finger hovered over the send button for minutes. But I did it, and I’m so glad I did. From that moment on, things between us only seemed to get more and more exciting. We spoke all the time, you started walking up my street with me, I invited you to join my group at the library on Sundays, I drove you home each time with you picking out all those Minecraft parody songs for the trip. I was still scared, but I knew things REALLY felt different.
        <br><br>
        Leading up to Star Wars café, I remember how exciting it was when we started spending time together outside of school just one-on-one. There was that weekend where we went to the library together twice in a weekend and I was so stressed about being late because I was watching the F1 movie at Village and it was running longer than I expected. I remember walking around Knox and buying our “fucked up freaks”, and how excited it got me to see you post about our hang-out on your story. I was always doubtful and scared, and as always I constantly overthought things, but I started noticing signs that you might actually reciprocate feelings. The way we spoke in groups was so obviously flirtatious to everybody around us, and it felt nice, but I was just scared of getting the wrong idea in my head and setting myself up for disappointment. It was so silly how I thought I was hiding my feelings about you.
        <br><br>
        I can’t remember what I said or even how flirtatious the conversation was, but I said something in Alec that prompted Vaishnavi to give me the wake-up call I needed. “What the heck you’re so smooth, so when are you asking her out?” It was a surprise in the moment, but I certainly didn’t deny anything about how I felt. She knew, after all. She was my hypewoman and she made me see the situation for what it was. Once I realised you actually could be feeling the same way I felt about you, I couldn’t feel more excited and nervous at the same time. I started updating Vaishnavi and Martin on everything that happened over the coming weeks.
        <br><br>
        We organised for you to come over to watch the Phantom Menace at my place after the library on Sunday to “prepare for Star Wars café” the next day. You stayed until almost midnight, invited me in to sign your whiteboard after I dropped you home, and things were feeling very real. Star Wars Café turned into an excuse for us to hang out all day at the museum, and then the city, and then it turned into an excuse for us to hang out all night watching Attack of the Clones. We both knew how we felt at that point, there’s no denying it. The next week that I spent on the Sunshine Coast was spent thinking about you and what could be. I decided it was going to happen. We went to the winter night market together the next Wednesday. The plan was always to confess while we walked around the market, but DAMN was I nervous. After much beating around the bush, we had that awkward “Sooo… what do you want this to be” exchange, and boom, it happened. The way I felt leaving your place after that night is something I can’t describe. It was actual euphoria. I had the biggest grin on my face.
        <br><br>
        I fell for you, and you fell for me, hard. I loved you to the point where you were bigger than life. You were everything. We spent over half a year of our lives giving our hearts away to each other and discovering who we were, together. I learned what it meant to love, how I loved, and how to be loved. You became my life and my reason for happiness. Our relationship felt so grown-up and special, and I really felt like it was forever. Unlike so many first loves, we didn’t fall half-way and reluctantly agree to be together, we fell head-over-knees for each other and we loved each other so deeply. I would look into your beautiful blue eyes and feel safe, like you were my home. It just felt right in every single way. You were the first and only person who I truly let know me. I was genuinely vulnerable around you. We went through so much together, I loved every moment of it. I liked how you made me feel in so many different ways, each for the first time. I really, really, fully loved you inside and out. I know you did too. We gave everything and I regret nothing.
        <br><br>
        When you taught me how to love, I learned that the people I love become who I am. At the end of the day, no matter the circumstances, my mind would always go to rest thinking about you. I learned that I wanted to feel connected to you all the time. The times when I felt connected to you were when I felt at my highest, but in the very few moments where you needed space and time away, I felt lonely and awfully low. I probably have an anxious attachment style. I worry when things don’t feel normal. You’re someone who loves deeply and fully exactly the same as me, and you love the connection the same as me, but you can’t do it all the time. Sometimes you really need the space and distance, and those times were challenging. The fact is, 95% of the time, our relationship was so intimate and affectionate, and we were able to spend all the time in the world together. The 5% where you didn’t feel yourself or you simply needed a social recharge, however, meant that you needed total space to yourself. That means no interaction, just total distance until you feel like being intimate again. Those times were hard. I worried and worried nonstop, because I loved you and I couldn’t stand the overthinking that caused me to think there was something wrong. When I would ask if everything is okay, the response was always “I’m fine”, even when they weren’t. I’m someone who needs to talk through every problem with the people I love because I simply need the reassurance. For these reasons, the times when you didn’t feel like talking or needed space were hard for both of us. You needed that space. I needed that connection and reassurance. It’s not a matter of one of us handling the situation healthier or better than the other person, it’s simply a matter of different attachment styles and different needs. These types of difficult moments were rare and usually short-lasting. For a huge majority of our relationship, we had energy for constant connection and intimacy. When that was the case, things felt amazing for the both of us because we were always having our needs met. However, an almost-perfect relationship isn’t fair. In those times when our needs conflicted with each other, it wasn’t fair on either of us to not feel ourselves.
        <br><br>
        It’s another kind of pain knowing that we loved each other so so much and yet that isn’t enough for us to both be the happiest versions of ourselves all the time. No regrets, no hatred, only love, but knowing it can’t work, and that it isn’t fair on either of us to try and make it work because that means trying to change who we are.
        <br><br>
        I’m lost without you. You were me and I was you, and now my days feel lonely and empty without you. I miss you every minute of every day and I could have never imagined losing you. I’ve cried my heart out over and over since I lost you, it’s the single most painful thing I’ve ever experienced. I know you don’t want me to, but I worry about you all the time because I don’t think I can ever stop caring about you. You’ve been such an enormous part of my life and you’re the best thing to have ever happened to me. I still love you, and I can’t imagine not loving you, but I know the decision is right. I told someone the day after losing you,
        <br>
        <blockquote>It’s hard to let go because I love her, but I’ll let go because I love her</blockquote><br> I know you worry about me. I’m hurting and right now it feels like it’s never going to stop, but I know I’ll be okay. I know you’ll be okay too, but I can’t ever stop worrying about you, and I hate myself for that. I don’t want to lose you completely from my life and I don’t think I can. We’ll always be friends and share something special, but nothing will compare to what we had. I’m so sorry things had to turn out the way they did. You’re the most special, sweetest, most beautiful girl, and I know you’re still figuring out who you are, but I just know you’re going to be okay.
        <br><br>
        Love you forever,
        William
